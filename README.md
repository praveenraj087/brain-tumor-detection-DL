# Brain Tumor Detection using MRI Segmentation

#### A deep learning model that aims to detect brain tumors if provided with an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reading. It is based on the U-Net architecture with an accuracy of about 80%. 
#### The need to use of semantic image segmentation is to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding class of what is being represented. Because weâ€™re predicting for every pixel in the image, this task is commonly referred to as dense prediction.

## Dataset
"Brain MRI Segmentation" from kaggle.
<br><br>
The dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. 
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). 
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
